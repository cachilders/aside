- ~~Internal LFO~~
  - ~~Consider 16 LFOs for MIDI + LFO for crow~~
- ~~Record MIDI events~~
  - ~~On events~~
  - ~~Off events~~
- ~~Echo MIDI events on fixed interval~~
- ~~Echo CV gate on fixed interval~~
- ~~Couple delay interval to LFO freq (some formula based on beat clock and sample freq)~~
- ~~Couple velocity LFO amplitude~~
- Params
  - Just the basics
  - Consider LFOs being parametric and available for external modulation
- Scale volts to midi and vice versa
  - Decide if it is window or direct note to freq scale 0 - 127 mapped to 0/-5 - 10
- Expand Midi
  - Panic
  - Allow instantiation of all midi devices
  - Allow parameter enable disable of any midi device
  - Allow echo routing (Midi to CV, CV to CV + Midi, Midi 1 to Midi 3 + 4, etc)
  - Respond to device added or removed (if needed)
  - MPE stuff? Probably below the line
---
- Outputs
  - Add NB
- Consider parameter to replace velocity change with scale degree changes?
- Other echo variations
- v/oct maybe uses delay as slew time on delay channel
